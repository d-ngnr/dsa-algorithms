    Reverses the given array using built-in Python functions and prints the reversed array.

    Parameters:
        arr (list): The array to be reversed.

    Returns:
        None

    Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input array.
    Space complexity: O(1), as only constant extra space is used.
